# Electric Phin (พิณ)
This is the model for a full sized 3 string electric Phin, a 3 String Thai lute.
Making this instrument required both CNC and 3D printed parts, as well as some hand tools for cleaning things up.


# Model/CAD
  The model posted here had been created using freeCAD.
  
  The scale length measures at XX and was matches a Phin I had bought in Thailand.

   <b>Pickups</b><br>
   The pickup bobbins were 3D printed, then neodyium magnets placed in their press-fit spots on the underside.<br>
   #6 iron deck screws were cut to length and placed in the top portion of the bobbin, making good contact with the magnets.<br>
   42 AWG Copper wire was then wrapped around the bobbin until a resistance of about 20K was reached using a multimeter.<br>
      
 <br><b>Wiring:</b><br>
 The pickups were wired to a 500K Potentiometer and 1/4'' output jack using the diagram from:<br>
